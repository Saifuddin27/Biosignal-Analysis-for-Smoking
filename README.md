# Biosignal-Analysis-for-Smoking

You are working as a data scientist in a global
company. Over the years, the company has
collected details and gathered a lot of
information about individuals. The
management wants to build an intelligent
system from the data to determine the
presence or absence of smoking in a person
through bio-signals. Given a personâ€™s
information, build a machine learning model
that can classify the presence or absence of
smoking.
